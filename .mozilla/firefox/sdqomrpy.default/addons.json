allow up to 10 minutes in every hour between 9am and 5pm).\n\nWith the lockdown feature, you can block sites immediately for a specified duration.\n\nYou can also set a password or random access code

your browser. This gives you a clear picture of what you were actually doing all day.\n\nIf you walk away from your computer for a few minutes, RescueTime automatically figures out when you're away and stops tracking.\n\nRescueTime does it's best to auto-categorize the sites you visit. It also scores them on a scale from Very Productive to Very Distracting. You can easily fine-tune the defaults to suit your needs. It's also simple to pause RescueTime, or delete any time you'd rather not have tracked.\n\nWhy it's awesome:\n\nYou’ll never have to ask \"Where the #@%! did my day go!?\" again. RescueTime lets you see how you spent your time on a day, week, or month basis.\n\nEveryone has those sites that they \"only check a couple times a day\" These can add up to a lot of time without you realizing it. RescueTime makes it easy to see.\n\nHaving good information and constant feedback helps you manage your time better, so you can spend your day the way you'd like.\n\nIf you already have a full RescueTime account, this extension will work hand-in-hand with it, giving you an at-a-glance view of all the time you are tracking.","weeklyDownloads":368,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"RescueTime","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/rescuetime/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/74/74303.png?modified=1530208987","width":700,"height":401,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/74/74303.png?modified=1530208987","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":183,"caption":"The RescueTime for Firefox window gives you an at-a-glance understanding of how your day is going."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/74/74305.png?modified=1530208987","width":700,"height":401,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/74/74305.png?modified=1530208987","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":183,"caption":"You can easily see how much time you have spent on the internet for the current day.
